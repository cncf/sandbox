# Welcome to CNCF Project Onboarding

This is an issue created to help onboard your project into the CNCF after the TOC has voted to accept your project.

We would like your project to complete onboarding within **one** month of acceptance.

Please track your progress by using "Quote reply" to create your own copy of this checklist in the issue, so that you can update the status as you finish items.

## REQUIRED BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH ONBOARDING

A "Project Contribution Agreement" must be completed and any existing trademarks **MUST** be transferred to the Linux Foundation **BEFORE** the CNCF staff onboarding tasks can be completed. Other tasks can be done by projects themselves in the meantime.

- [ ] Review and understand the [CNCF IP Policy](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/charter.md#11-ip-policy). Ensure you are using a CNCF compatible license; inbound projects must use the Apache 2.0 license or [seek approval for exceptions](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/issues/new?template=license-exception-request.yaml). Licenses for dependencies are covered separately below.
- [ ] Review and understand the [CNCF Third Party License Policy](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/policies-guidance/allowed-third-party-license-policy.md#cncf-allowlist-license-policy). This policy governs the licenses used by third party libraries in your project. CNCF FOSSA or CNCF Snyk are configured to check that projects are in compliance with this policy. Let us know which service you would prefer to use.
- [ ] Review and understand the [LF trademark guidelines](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/trademark-usage). Let the TOC know if you plan to change your project name.
- [ ] Transfer any [trademark and logo assets to the Linux Foundation](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/tree/main/agreements) via the Contribution Agreement. CNCF staff will send this document to the contact emails listed in the Sandbox application.

## Review and understand other documents

- [ ] The [Technical Leadership Principles](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/PRINCIPLES.md#technical-leadership-principles) that outline the expected behavior for any maintainer in a leadership role.
- [ ] The [project proposal process and requirements](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/README.md).
- [ ] The [services available for your project at the CNCF](https://contribute.cncf.io/resources/project-services/).
- [ ] The [online program guidelines](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/policies-guidance/online-programs-guidelines.md).
- [ ] The [telemetry data collection and usage policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/telemetry-data-policy).
- [ ] Optional: [Book time with CNCF staff](http://project-meetings.cncf.io) to understand project benefits and event resources or ask other questions.

## Contribute and transfer other materials

- [ ] Move your project to its own separate neutral GitHub organization. This will make it transferable to the CNCF's GitHub Enterprise account. If it's already in another GHE account, you will need to remove it from that first.
- [ ] Accept the invite to join the CNCF GitHub Enterprise account. We'll then add `thelinuxfoundation` as an organization owner to ensure neutral hosting of your project.
- [ ] Migrate your Slack channels (if any) to the [Kubernetes or CNCF Slack workspace](https://slack.com/help/articles/217872578-Import-data-from-one-Slack-workspace-to-another). CNCF staff can help. This allows project communities to be more discoverable, allows the CNCF to enforce its Code of Conduct, and enables unlimited message retention.
- [ ] Join the [#maintainers-circle](https://app.slack.com/client/T08PSQ7BQ/C014YQ8CDCG) Slack channel to find and share knowledge with other project teams.
- [ ] Transfer [your domain(s) to the CNCF](https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/2/create/1374) if they exist. The "LF Stakeholder email" is <projects@cncf.io>. The "Project" is CNCF.
- [ ] Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/cncf/artwork) with your artwork if it exists. If you don't have artwork, CNCF can help design some.
- [ ] Transfer website analytics if they exist. Make <projects@cncf.io> an admin of your existing Google Analytics org account so that we can move it to a CNCF-managed account.

## Update and document project details

- [ ] Create a maintainer list and add it to the [aggregated CNCF maintainer list](https://maintainers.cncf.io) via pull request.
- [ ] Provide maintainer emails to get access to the mailing list and Service Desk. Send them to <project-onboarding@cncf.io>. These aren't shared publicly in the spreadsheet above which is why they must be emailed to us.
- [ ] Ensure that [DCO](https://github.com/apps/dco) are enabled for all GitHub repositories of the project. You may also choose to use a [CLA](https://github.com/cncf/cla).
- [ ] Ensure that that the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md) (or your adopted version of it) are explicitly referenced in the project's `README.md` on GitHub.
- [ ] Ensure the LF footer is on your website and [guidelines](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/policies-guidance/website-guidelines.md) are followed (if your project doesn't have a dedicated website, please adopt those guidelines for the `README.md` file).
- [ ] Start working on [written, open governance](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/governance/) and consider adding this to a `GOVERNANCE.md` file at the root of your repo.
- [ ] Start working on a [security policy](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository) and consider adding this to a `SECURITY.md` file at the root of your repo.
- [ ] Start working on an [OpenSSF Best Practices Badge](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en).
- [ ] Import all project repos into your chosen license scanning service (CNCF FOSSA of CNCF Snyk).

## CNCF staff tasks to support the project

- [ ] Add the project to [DevStats](https://devstats.cncf.io/).
- [ ] Add the project to [CLOmonitor](https://clomonitor.io/).
- [ ] Add the project to [LFX Insights](https://insights.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/). This is done by adding a read-only app to your GitHub organization once it's in CNCF GHE.
- [ ] Add the project to the [Cloud Native Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io) by updating [landscape.yml](https://github.com/cncf/landscape/blob/master/landscape.yml) following these [instructions](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2/blob/main/docs/config/data.yml).
- [ ] Activate the project in the [LFX Project Control Center](https://projectadmin.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/a0941000002wBz4AAE).
- [ ] Add the maintainers team to a license scanner service, either, CNCF [FOSSA](https://fossa.com/) or CNCF [Snyk](https://snyk.io/).
- [ ] Create groups.io project maintainer list in PCC
- [ ] Add project's groups.io maintaner list to [maintainers@cncf.io](https://groups.google.com/a/cncf.io/g/maintainers/members)
- [ ] Send a welcome email to confirm maintainer list access.
